Define graph; A graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices
When vertices are adjacent to one another ?; When there is an edge connecting two vertices, we say that the vertices are adjacent to one another
When edge is incident to both vertices ?; When there is an edge connecting two vertices, we say that the vertices are adjacent to one another and that the edge is incident to both vertices
Define degree of the vertice; The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
Define subgraph; A subgraph is a subset of a graphâ€™s edges (and associated vertices) that constitutes a graph.
Define a path within a graph; A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges.
Define a simple path within a graph;  A simple path is one with no repeated vertices.
Define a cycle within a graph; A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. 
Define a simple cycle within a graph; A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repeti- tion of the first and last vertices)
Define a lengh of path within a graph; The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.
When one vertex is connected to another ?; We say that one vertex is connected to another if there exists a path that contains both of them.
When graph considered to be connected ? ; A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex toe very other vertex in the graph
Define acyclic graph; An acyclic graph is a graph without a cycles
Define a tree; A tree is an acyclic connected graph
Define a forest; A disjoint set of trees called a forest
Define a spanning tree; A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graph vertices and is a single tree
Define a spannign forest of a graph; A spanning forest of a graph is the union of spanning trees of its connected components
Define a bipartite graph; A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets such that all edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.
